- Use functional React components instead of class components.
- Apply Tailwind CSS for styling; avoid inline styles.
- Components should be modular and reusable.
- Maintain a consistent and clear component structure.
- Do not inline SVG icons directly in components. Instead store all SVG icons as React components in `src/icons/icons.tsx`  and import them as needed.
